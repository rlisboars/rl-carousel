# rl-carousel
A simple jquery carousel.
This project was created due the need of a carousel for my portfolio page. As I'm in a learning stage, I prefered to create a new module to test my skills and learn more about git versioning.

#### Issues to be fixed:
- Browser compatibility. Currently tested only on Google Chrome
- Resizing screen can affect sections control when last section has less projects than full sections.

#### To-do
- Projects with different sizing (full and half of section).
